* WHAT THIS IS
These are the Industria libraries for R6RS Scheme. It's are more or
less a place for me to put the Scheme code I write.

* AVAILABLE LIBRARIES
** (se weinholt disassembler x86)
Disassembler for the Intel x86 architecture. Supports most modern
instructions encodings as of 2008, including the VEX prefix used by
Intel AVX and the DREX encoding used by AMD SSE5. Supports 16-bit,
32-bit and 64-bit modes. The API consists of `get-instruction', which
reads the next instruction on a port using the given bit-mode and
returns the instruction as a list. See the source code for
documentation.

** (se weinholt disassembler x86-opcodes)
An opcode table for the Intel x86 that includes all SSE instructions
up to SSE5, all Intel AVX instructions and of course the AMD64
instructions. The table layout is designed for use with a
disassembler, but it can also be transformed for use in an assembler.

** (define-values)
This is a define-values macro which, unlike previous R5RS instances of
the same, permits the defined variables to be exported from libraries.
It can be used anywhere the normal define works.

(define-values (foo bar)
  (values 1 2))

** (se weinholt net irc)
A parser and formatter for the Internet Relay Chat protocol. Should be
usable both for clients and servers. It can split IRC messages into
prefix, command and argument parts and it also does the inverse.

** (se weinholt struct pack)
C compatible structure packer and unpacker. The pack function produces
a bytevector from a format string and some values and the unpack
syntax does the opposite. They are similar to Python's struct module
or Perl's pack/unpack functions. Fields are aligned with their natural
alignment, i.e. their own size. Useful for reading and writing binary
files or network protocols. See the top of the library source code for
documentation.

* TEST ROUTINES
The tests/ directory contains scripts that test the libraries. Can
also be useful if you want to see how a library is used.

* PROGRAMS
The programs/ directory contains small utilities that use the
libraries. These scripts are implemented in the way recommended by
R6RS non-normative appendix D. The file names follow the Unix
convention, so if you use an adult operating system you will need to
rename them.

** fcdisasm
The Full-Color Disassembler, which disassembles x86 code and colors
the bytes in the hexdump. This makes it easy to see how many bytes all
the different parts of an instruction uses.

** meircbot
The Minimum-Effort IRC bot. The script contains the configuration. It
doesn't do anything other than joining channels and being rude in
private messages. Shows how the (se weinholt net irc) library can be
used. It requires tcp-connect and uses printf from (ikarus).
