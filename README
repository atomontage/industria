* WHAT THIS IS
These are the Industria libraries for R6RS Scheme. It's more or less a
place for me to put the Scheme code I write.

Here's the project website:
<https://code.launchpad.net/~weinholt/scheme-libraries/industria>

Here's an alternative website: <https://weinholt.se/industria/>.

* DOCUMENTATION
For the complete manual, please see the Texinfo document in the
documentation directory. Use these commands to build it:

makeinfo industria.texinfo                    # info format
makeinfo --plaintext industria.texinfo        # text format
makeinfo --no-split --html industria.texinfo  # html format
texi2pdf industria.texinfo                    # pdf format

* PROGRAMS
The programs/ directory contains small utilities that use the
libraries. These scripts are implemented in the way recommended by
R6RS non-normative appendix D.

** checksum
Compute the hash or CRC of a file. Give it an algorithm and filenames
and off it goes. It also demonstrates the superior slowness of the
hashing libraries.

** fcdisasm
The Full-Color Disassembler, which disassembles x86 code and colors
the bytes in the hexdump. This makes it easy to see how many bytes all
the different parts of an instruction uses.

** meircbot
The Minimum-Effort IRC bot. The script contains the configuration. It
doesn't do anything other than joining channels and being rude in
private messages. Shows how the (weinholt net irc) library can be
used. It requires tcp-connect and the (xitomatl AS-match).

** x86-demo
A demonstration of the (weinholt assembler x86) library. The program
assembles a Multiboot image, which can be loaded by GNU GRUB. The demo
uses the VGA text mode and a few VGA registers to generate a classic
copper bar effect.
