@node Installation
@section Installation

The simple version: install Akku from
@url{https://github.com/weinholt/akku}. Run @code{akku install} in the
your project directory. This fetches the Industria and its
dependencies and install them to @code{.akku}. Run @code{.akku/env} to
start using Industria in your R6RS Scheme of choice.

The longer, more manual, version: extend your Scheme library search
path to include the @code{industria} directory, e.g.@: if you're using
Chez Scheme on a Unix system and you unpacked Industria in
@code{~/scheme}:
@verbatim
export CHEZSCHEMELIBDIRS=$HOME/scheme
@end verbatim

Other possible environment variables include @code{IKARUS_LIBRARY_PATH},
@code{LARCENY_LIBPATH}, @code{MOSH_LOADPATH} and @code{YPSILON_SITELIB}.
For more details please refer to your Scheme implementation's
documentation.
An alternative is to move or symlink the @code{industria} directory into a
directory that already exists in your Scheme's search path.
Download the dependencies noted in the Akku.lock file and install them
in the library path.

Releases and the latest source code for Industria are available at
GitHub @url{https://github.com/weinholt/industria/}.

@node Usage
@section Usage
To load an R6RS library into your program or library, put it in the
@code{import} specification. Here's Hello World for R6RS Scheme:

@lisp
#!/usr/bin/env scheme-script
(import (rnrs))
(display "Hello World!\n")
@end lisp
@cindex Hello World, example

The first line is useful on Unix systems, but it is specified in the
R6RS Non-Normative Appendices, so your Scheme might not accept
programs with that line present.

See the @code{programs/} and @code{tests/} directories for examples.
